NOAA Fisheriesâ€™ Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs) were developed using
secondary data including social, demographic and fisheries variables. The social and
demographic data were downloaded from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-yr
estimates Dataset at the U.S. Census American FactFinder site for coastal communities
at the Census Designated Place (CDP) level, and in some cases the County Subdivision
(MCD) level. Commercial fisheries data were pulled from the Commercial fisheries database (CFDBS).
The recreational fishing information is publicly accessible through the Marine Recreational Information
Program (MRIP). More information including processing and indicator derivation steps are available at
