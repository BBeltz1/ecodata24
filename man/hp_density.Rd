\details{
From the AMAPPS Marine Mammal Model Viewer Site: "Distribution and abundance of wildlife is largely driven by physical and biological environmental
factors, including climate, habitat characteristics and prey distribution (Ainley et al. 2005). To
account for this, these spatially- and temporally-explicit density maps were based on animal
density - environmental generalized additive statistical models that were fit to visual shipboard
and aerial survey line-transect data, associated survey conditions, animal group characteristics,
spatially- and temporally-explicit static and dynamic environmental data, and species-specific
availability bias correction factors. For a more completed description see Palka et al. 2017."
