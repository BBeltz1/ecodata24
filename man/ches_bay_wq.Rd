\description{
A multimetric indicator describing the attainment status of Chesapeake Bay with
respect to three water quality standards criteria: dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, and
water clarity/submerged aquatic vegetation.
}
\details{
To protect the aquatic living resources of Chesapeake Bay, the Chesapeake Bay Program
(CBP) partnership has developed a guidance framework of ambient water quality criteria with
designated uses and assessment procedures for dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, and water
clarity/submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) (USEPA, 2003) . To achieve consistent
assessment over time and between jurisdictions, a multimetric indicator was proposed by the
CBP partnership to provide a means for tracking the progress in all 92 management segments
of Chesapeake Bay (USEPA, 2017). This indicator has been computed for each three-year
assessment period since 1985-1987, providing an integrated measure of Chesapeake Bayâ€™s
water quality condition over the last three decades.
